lipsia (2.1.0svn191-0) stable; urgency=low

  * Removed vpreproc_gui
  * Revised the REQUIREMENTS file
  * Fixed bug in vcheckdesign when showing powerspectrum
  * Fixed bug in valign3d. (saving a rigid transform as a vector deformationmap discards the rotation information)
  * New program: vnormdata. This program is a little wrapper script which performs a nonlinear normalization to
    a functional data set. Specifying an anatomical image will force vnormdata to use this one to find the transform to
    the reference image.
  * Revised the documentation
  * Renamed vtrialaver to vtrialaverage
  * Added niftov and vtonifti for backward-compatibility -> so we got Lipsia
    got the dependency to nifti again.
